Welcome to the Django Contacts App! This simple app allows you to manage and display a list of contacts, view individual contact details, and access a helpful information page.

#### Steps to Setup

1. **Project Setup:**

   - Started the Django project named `mycontacts`.
   - Created the `contacts` app using the command `python manage.py startapp contacts`.

2. **Templates and Static Files:**

   - Created a `templates` folder within the `contacts` app for HTML files.
   - Added `index.html`, `contacts.html`, and `help.html` with initial HTML structure.
   - Organized static files in a `static/css` folder, including a `styles.css` file for styling.

3. **Settings Configuration:**

   - Updated `settings.py`:
     - Added the `contacts` app to `INSTALLED_APPS`.
     - Included the `templates` directory in the `DIRS` of the `TEMPLATES` setting.

4. **Models and Database Migration:**

   - Defined a `Contact` model in `models.py` with fields like `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `phone_number`.
   - Ran migrations (`python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`) to create the database tables.

5. **Admin Interface:**

   - Created a superuser (`python manage.py createsuperuser`) and added a couple of contacts using the admin interface.

6. **Views and URLs:**

   - Updated `views.py` to include views for the contact list, contact details, and help pages.
   - Configured URL patterns in `urls.py` to map to these views.

   - Styled the pages using CSS in the `styles.css` file.
   - Applied a modern and clean design to enhance the user experience.

8. **Contact Details Page (contacts.html):**

   - Included dummy data for a contact's name, email, and phone number.
